This is a task given by ALX on HTML advance.

The tasks:

1. Task 0 - README and objectives!
   - In this and coming projects, you will implement from scratch a webpage from a designer file. - For this first project, you will focus on the HTML structure only - no CSS, no style - just pure HTML semantic. - This designer file will be available on Figma (figma.com) - feel free to create an account to access the final result here:
   - page in Figma (https://www.figma.com/file/dyYL6Ku4WG7vsdpwvlcJZC/Homepage?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=Y64GosVN7rOAWuCF-0)
   - fig file (https://www.figma.com/file/dyYL6Ku4WG7vsdpwvlcJZC/Homepage?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=hsZjlPq9YDLaX2NI-0)
     And "Duplicate to your Drafts" to have access to all design details. - Important notes with figma:
   - If your computer doesn't have missing fonts, you can find them here: source-sans-pro (https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro) and Spin-Cycle-OT (https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Spin-Cycle-OT)
   - some values are in float - feel free to round them.
